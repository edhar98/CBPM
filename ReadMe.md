This project involves using machine learning techniques to classify astronomical sources like stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their characteristics. 

The following dependencies are required to run the code:

- numpy
    Description: A library for numerical computations in Python.
    Installation: You can install it using the command pip install numpy.
- pandas
    Description: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames to organize and manipulate tabular data.
    Installation: You can install it using the command pip install pandas.
- seaborn
    Description: A data visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.
    Installation: You can install it using the command pip install seaborn.
- matplotlib
    Description: A widely used plotting library in Python that provides tools to create a variety of plots and visualizations.
    Installation: You can install it using the command pip install matplotlib.
- sklearn
    Description: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides tools for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.
    Installation: You can install scikit-learn using the command pip install scikit-learn.
    
To Install all neccessary modules run the following command from the shell:
```
    pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
